Thanks to the sponsorship of my company Archiact, I was given the opportunity to experience this year Siggraph with a full-conference pass. This 5-day conference was quite an informative and mind-blowing journey. During all types of events I had a great time getting involved with the CG community and learning from the best of the industry. **Here I summarized my journey of Siggraph 2018 and documented all the related resources for future reference.**

# Background
Siggraph is the annual conference on computer graphics (CG) and is widely considered the most prestigious forum for the publication of computer graphics research. It is held in different cities in North America every year and this time it is back to my city, Vancouver.

<!-- At work I am a technical artist working mainly in Unreal Engine. I also used to work in Unity especially on creating customized shaders with Unity ShaderLab.  -->
My current project at work is [Evasion](https://evasionvrgame.com/) which is a [PS4](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/evasion-ps4/)/[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/683000/Evasion/) multiplayer VR game made entirely in Unreal. During the development of Evasion, I've been responsible for the implementation of art assets with Blueprint, creating and optimizing shaders and game VFX (particle systems, shader effects, physics destruction effects) and general GPU profiling and optimization. At spare time, I also have great passion on researching and implementing physically based rendering theories and technologies. So for this time in Siggraph, I focused myself mainly on **game rendering courses, tech art in production, Epic sessions on Unreal Engine and talks about real-time raytracing**.

## Course: Introduction To Vulkan Graphics API
Started my conference on Sunday morning with the course - Introduction To Vulkan Graphics API. Course walked through the whole API from design to code implementation. It was one of the [Khronos-related events](https://www.khronos.org/events/2018-siggraph) at this year Siggraph.

> Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs to mobile phones and embedded platforms. This course will be of interest to anyone who writes high-performance interactive graphics programs. [Class Materials](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/vulkan/).

## Talks: It's a material world
In this [session](https://s2018.siggraph.org/session/?sess=sess287), researchers from the industry presented their latest work on rendering complex materials.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2018-08-16-my-siggraph-2018-1/siggraph-2.JPG" width="480"  style="display:block; margin:auto;">

The first talk [Plausible iris caustics and limbal arc rendering](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_144&sess=sess287) presented by Disney was especially inspiring.

The graphic researcher in Disney took reference of how real human eye responding to various lighting angles, delved into anatomy level of eye to correctly model the eye-light interaction and finally calculated results with real anatomical data. ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214751/a15-chiang.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214751&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534722028_4a502d08d9333e38985659126dda8e62))

Second talk was [Prelit materials: light transport for live-action elements in production rendering](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_117&sess=sess287) by Animal Logic.([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214746/a18-agland.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214746&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534734364_2ecd6b3caa23f8e66b92d0f05a0035d9))

## Panel: Design and implementation of modern production renderers
Just out of a fan-boy mindset, I rushed to this panel after previous event just wanted to see all those 6 legendary developers/owners of 5 current industry-leading production renderers: ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214901/a4-pharr.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214901&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534744633_50f096c3de844b27ae09b57491e5ee89))

## Papers Fast Forward
This was my first time attending this classic conventional session of Siggraph. So many unique ideas was presented in such a fast-pacing style, challenging the intelligence and imagination of the audiences. Some of them are extremely inspiring and certainly will lead to some revolutionary technologies for the future of computer graphics. ([Full Video](https://youtu.be/CV_14aUBxsI))

## Siggraph Reception
It was a tough day with all those intense advanced rendering courses. Luckily it was wrapped up with an amazing reception event including nice buffet and an insanely huge venue for industry networking:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Social Anxiety MAX 😂 @ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SIGGRAPH2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SIGGRAPH2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/oYQa7r3USO">pic.twitter.com/oYQa7r3USO</a></p>&mdash; Victor @ Siggraph (@viclw17) <a href="https://twitter.com/viclw17/status/1029212942862966784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

During the event I was submerged by all the energy brought by the people from all around the world focusing on different fields within computer graphics - gaming, rendering, film-making etc. I bumped into quite a few rendering engineers and technical artists working either in game or film VFX, and had a great time sharing thoughts and experience. One funny moment was in the middle of a conversation with a graphics engineer, I was suddenly told to hold on talking and take a look at an old man that just passed by,

"Did you see that? That's [Jim Blinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Blinn)!" His face was filled with great respect and excitement, "One of the most cool things about Siggraph is, you can always meet some living legend of the industry."

# Day 3
## Talks: For Love of Tech Art
Amazing session focus on technical art in game/film production especially the first one **Technical Art of Sea of Thieves** ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214820/a46-ang.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214820&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534751899_a55beeb3f72507d39f478bc9d56580ab))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15F04iBVJxg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe>

The talk covered few tech art challenges the developers encountered for the game and how they solved the problems with R&D and some creative "tech art tricks". They specifically presented visual technologies and tool developed for
- ocean surface rendering
- dynamic water surface on the boat
- volumetric clouds
- tentacle simulations
- lightning effect
- GPU-calculated ropes and pulleys

Later the second talk from Pixar - Reinterpreting Memorable Characters in Incredibles 2 - walked through their iteration on character design and model/rigs. ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214784/a47-hamou-lhadj.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214784&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534752277_d6a56ebe023c79e0ba673ba47054e305))

<!-- ## [SCRIPTABLE RENDER PIPELINE FROM SCRATCH](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?sess=sess451&id=gensubcur_135#038;id=gensubcur_135)
Rendering allows you to control many aspects of a scene, how it looks, what tone is conveyed, and how it is stylized. In this course you will learn the basics of the Unity Scriptable Render Pipeline by creating a renderer from scratch. This renderer will include opaque and transparent rendering as well as simple lighting. -->

## Exhibition Hall
Today was the opening day of the main Siggraph exhibition. It included multiple sections ranging from industry companies showcasing to student research demoing. There was also an art gallery to show production assets (costume, models,concept arts) and a studio to make customized swags and 3D printed models.
