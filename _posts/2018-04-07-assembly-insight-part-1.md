Just came across [this Gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOyaJXpAYZQ&t=0s&list=WL&index=48) when browsing cat videos on Youtube. After watching it I decided to run through the case by myself on my mac to see how a C program is working under the hood. I also want to be a bit geeky this time - just use Vim to write raw C program, and use command line to compile the program and also run the executable. Everything in the terminal.

# Compile and Run C Program

First, here is the C program for testing - the same as the testing case in the video. Save it as `fib.c`.

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int x, y, z;
    x = 0;
    y = 1;
    do
    {
        printf("%d\n", x);
        z = x + y;
        x = y;
        y = z;
    } while (x < 255);
}
```

Secondly, use `gcc` to compile the .c program - type command `gcc fib.c`. GCC is *GNU Compiler Collection, a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages*. Also we can use `clang` - type command `clang fib.c`. Clang is *a compiler front end for the programming languages C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, OpenMP, OpenCL, and CUDA, designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection.*

This will compile the program and generate `a.out` file. To run the executable we have to use command `./a.out`.

`a.out` is a file format used in older versions of Unix-like computer OS for executables, object code, and, in the later systems, shared libraries. This is an abbreviated form of *"assembler output"*. Also we can use `clang -o fib fib.c` to generate file `fib` instead of the default `a.out` :)

# Assembly Insight

Then use command `otool -tv fib` to observe the corresponding assembly code of our compiled C program. `otool` is *object file displaying tool*, `-t` is to print the text section and `-v` is to disassemble it to make it readable.

And we got:
``` bash
fib:
(__TEXT,__text) section
_main:

0000000100000f31        movq    %rsp, %rbp

0000000100000f5e        movl    -0x8(%rbp), %esi
# x is moved into %esi register

# y is added into %esi register
0000000100000f64        movl    %esi, -0x10(%rbp) # z = x + y;
# %esi is moved into z
0000000100000f67        movl    -0xc(%rbp), %esi
0000000100000f6a        movl    %esi, -0x8(%rbp) # x = y;

0000000100000f6d        movl    -0x10(%rbp), %esi
0000000100000f70        movl    %esi, -0xc(%rbp) # y = z;
# z is moved into y
0000000100000f73        movl    %eax, -0x14(%rbp)
# %eax contains the return value of the printf call
0000000100000f76        cmpl    $0xff, -0x8(%rbp) # while(x < 255);
# cmpl (compare long) compare x with 255($0xff)
0000000100000f7d        jl      0x100000f4d

0000000100000f83        movl    -0x4(%rbp), %eax
0000000100000f86        addq    $0x20, %rsp
0000000100000f8a        popq    %rbp
0000000100000f8b        retq

# Assembly Syntax Explanation

## movl vs movq

([Source](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-movq-and-movl-assembly-instruction)) When using [GAS(GNU Assembler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Assembler) assembly language mnemonics for an Intel CPU, then:

* movq moves a quadword (64-bits) from source to destination.
* movl moves a long (32-bits) from source to destination.

Note that, in the Intel x86 world, a word is 16 bits, a doubleword is 32 bits (two 16-bit words), and a quadword is 64 bits (four 16-bit words).

GAS syntax uses these suffixes (e.g., q, l, b, etc.) on the instruction mnemonics to indicate how much data is being moved.

The Intel syntax doesnâ€™t use suffixes, but instead uses the register name to deduce the amount of data, since each register has a known size. So, in Intel syntax, both instructions would use the same mnemonic: mov.

Also note that, in GAS syntax, the source operand appears first, and the destination operand appears second. This is the reverse order of the [Intel syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax), where the destination operand appears first, and the source operand appears second.
